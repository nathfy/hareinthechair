<p>Commissioning your own bespoke chair is simple. These are the steps we will go through.</p>
<p><strong> Step one. </strong></p>
<p>Contact me via email with an image of the chair you would like reupholstered. It is beneficial to have images of the
    chair from different angles so I can get a rough idea of the piece&rsquo;s condition.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Step two: </strong></p>
<p>I will contact you with my initial thoughts about what the piece may require in terms of refurbishment. Whether it is
    something I can take on and an idea of the cost of the different options.</p>
<p>I am likely to recommend one of 3 options;</p>
<p><em><strong>Recover-</strong></em> The piece is in good condition, and the upholstery remains sound and comfortable.
    The top cover may be outdated or worn and requires changing.</p>
<p><em><strong>Refurbishment -</strong></em> The upholstery may be showing signs of wear, for example, the seat may be
    sagging. The general shape is still in good order. This sort of condition can be given a new lease of life whilst
    still retaining some of the original upholstery. For example; The original upholstery can be carefully removed and
    springs re-sewn and lashed into position. The original pad can be replaced and a &lsquo;cap&rsquo; stitched over, to
    give it more longevity. The process is still time-consuming and requires skill but you will save on materials and
    there is less waste.</p>
<p><em><strong>Full Reupholstery-</strong></em> The original stuffing may be in bad condition, or previously not done
    well so it is not worth saving. In this case, we will go right back to the frame, and make good any wobble or damage
    to the wood. Then using fresh materials upholster the whole piece using traditional techniques. This is a bigger
    job, requiring many hours and skill, but it will be good for many decades to come.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong></p>
<p>Consultation. We will then arrange a consultation where I can introduce you to some potential fabric and you can talk
    me through the ideas you have. Ideally, this will be face-to-face, however, if this is not possible we can do it
    remotely. You may have lots of ideas or none, I can help in either of the scenarios. I&rsquo;ll ask you to fill out
    a brief questionnaire prior to the consultation so I can gather the appropriate samples. This is also the chance for
    me to measure up your chairs, so I can accurately order the correct amount of fabric needed. I am all ears to the
    ideas you have. For many people, the chair is already very special, but if you want something to make it even more
    bespoke then do let me know.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong></p>
<p>Once all the details are set, I can begin work. I will send you a final estimate and I ask for 50% of this to be paid
    upfront so that I can order the materials required. I will give you an idea of how long the piece with take to be
    lovingly upholstered and get it back to you as quickly as possible.</p>
