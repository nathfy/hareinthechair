    The top fabric of a chair is a bit like an iceberg; beautiful, and often the only part that is actually seen, however
    there is often so much more underneath, especially when the furniture has been upholstered using traditional
    methods.

    A typical, traditionally upholstered chair may consist of nine or ten different layers. Look underneath a chair and
    you will most likely see a cotton or hessian bottom cloth, this will be concealing the webbing; herringbone woven
    straps tacked to the base to support you as you sit. Tied into this may be coil springs, covered by a platform of
    hessian. This provides a base for the first stuffing- often made from Coir (coconut husk fibre). The coir will
    likely be stitched to the shape of the frame using linen twine. This is what keeps the chairs&rsquo; shape year
    after year, bottom after bottom. A softer second stuffing of animal hair or wool is then applied, covered by a thin
    layer of wool, pulled in tightly with calico, and then, finally the top cover is applied. Each layer has its role
    and together these make a durable seat that even when the top cover fabric wears out or is no longer in vogue will
    still be usable for many decades.</p>

    It is important to us at Hare in the Chair to rebuild and refurbish in ways that are kind both to the user and the
    environment. For that reason we aim to where possible use materials that are biodegradable and durable. The image
    above shows a headboard being stitched up. The filling is Coir (coconut fibre) it is held within a hessian (jute)
    scrim and stitched with linen twine.

    There is much ongoing research about the negative impact on our health of chemicals required by law to make foam fire
    retardant. For this reason we have taken the decision to not use or replace foam in our work. There are a number of
    alternatives that we use and we are always looking for more.</p>
